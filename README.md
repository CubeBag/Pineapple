## 1.0 Introduction
Pineapple is an esoteric programming language inspired by Pool, Ly, and Brainfuck. The language takes just seconds to learn, so you can get started programming right away and innovative.

## 1.1 Commands I
A Pineapple program consists of three sections:
 - An integer between 0 and 9 (any number outside these bounds will result in a Syntax Error
 - The letter `p` (any other letter will result in a Syntax Error)
 - A string of any length

The integer will take up the first character, and `p` will take up the second character.
First, the integer will be printed to the screen, then the string will be printed to the screen (integer) times. So, if your program looks like this:
`4pHello World!`
the output will look like this:
`4Hello World!Hello World!Hello World!Hello World!`

## 1.2 Conclusion
This language is the next leap forward. It is fast, innovative, easy-to-learn, and the possibilities are endless.*
